# pytorch-deepdream


changes/improvements/features:
-----------------------------------------------
1)- runs online, no installation or even a python enviroment required.

2)- no programming experience or code modification needed

3)- automatic upload photo button and UI. no typing needed. all done with just a couple clicks.

4)- instant preview of your modifications, (get the hang quickly of what each thing does)

5)- no image size limitation/truncation, HD images supported. 

6)- insanely fast results, basicly real-time. faster than any other repository.

7)- very good quality + ability to customize it down to exact neuron/layer (etc)

8)- includes the ability to do the "Deep Dream Zoom" effect. 

9)- fixxed all errors, automatically acquires & sets correct dependencies

10)- enhanced backward compatability, runtime is now also python-3 compatable  

11)- added helpful tips in code to show when to go to next step (etc)
